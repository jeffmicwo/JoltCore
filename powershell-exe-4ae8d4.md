PowerShell.exe is a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft, primarily designed for system administration and automation tasks within the Windows operating system, with the version 10.0.15063.0 being one of its iterations. As a legitimate Microsoft product, PowerShell is generally considered safe; however, it can be exploited by malicious actors to execute harmful scripts or commands, leading to potential virus or malware activities if used improperly. It is important to monitor its usage on a system, as suspicious activities or errors may indicate unauthorized access or script execution. Users should ensure that their security software is up-to-date and be vigilant about the scripts they run to mitigate risks associated with PowerShell, balancing its powerful automation capabilities with necessary precautions against misuse.
